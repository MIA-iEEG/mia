MIA™ is a Matlab toolbox to analyze intracerebral EEG signals over multiple patients.

MIA was developed by A.-Sophie Dubarry at the Laboratoire de Psychologie Cognitive and Laboratoire Parole et Langage (CNRS, Aix-Marseille) in collaboration with Catherine Liégeois-Chauvel (Cleveland Clinic), Agnès Trébuchon (INS, La Timone), Christian Bénar (INS) F.-Xavier Alario (LPC). The software has been successfully used in last 3 years to support intracerebral EEG signal analysis in studies published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at neuroscience International meetings (see list below).

MIA™ toolbox is completely FREE for all Non-Commercial Academic Applications under Creative Commons Public License (CCPL BY-NC-ND).

DISCLAIMER:  MIA™ was implemented and released for research purposes only. MIA™ toolbox, or data obtained from MIA toolbox, should not be used for clinical purposes.
